# ihaskell-pwd
A pwd directory template for the [crosscompass/ihaskell-notebook](https://github.com/jamesdbrock/ihaskell-notebook) docker image
with some utility shell scripts.

Assuming there is a running Docker service set up for you, you can use
  * `run.sh` to run the ihaskell-notebook docker image from this directory.
  * `build.sh` inside the docker image's `pwd` directory. (use Jupyter's terminal for this)
